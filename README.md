# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-contracts)
intends to document requirements and referential material to implement
data contracts in the perspective of data engineering on a
modern data stack (MDS).

Data contracts are essential to decouple data producers from data consumers,
while having both parties taking responsibility for their respective parts.

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.

# Specifications
* Data contract as code (DCaC) principle: the data contracts must be specified
  thanks to an
  [Interface Definition Language (IDL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language),
  for instance [Smithy](https://smithy.io/), [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/),
  [OpenDataMesh](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/),
  [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/) or [dbt schema](https://getdbt.com)
  
* Shift-left principle: as much as meta-data as possible should be
  written directly within the IDL-based data contracts, potentially
  through annotations and/or naming conventions as comments
  
* The idea behind the two above-mentioned principles is to have the IDL-based
  specifications materializing the
  [single version of the truth (SVOT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_version_of_the_truth)
  for the data sets, while benefitting from the whole automation and tooling
  that an open standard such as OpenDataMesh, Smithy and Protobuf bring

* The data contracts should support at least the following features:
  + Data validation / Data quality - From the data contracts, we should be
    able to generate specifications for specific tools such as
	[Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/),
	[Deequ](https://github.com/awslabs/deequ),
	[dbt data testing](https://www.getdbt.com/product/data-testing/)
	or [SODA data quality platform](https://www.soda.io/data-quality-platform)
  + Generation of data schemas for a few specific compute enginees such as
    [Spark data types](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html),
    [Flink data types](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/types/),
    [Python Dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html),
	[Pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
	[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)
	or [Pandas](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-quality-check-for-your-data-analysis-tutorial-with-pandas-7ee96d7dc4b6)

# Definitions

## Definition by Andrew Jones
* Source: [https://andrew-jones.com/blog/data-contracts/](https://data-contracts.com/)

> A data contract is an agreed **interface** between the generators of data and its consumers.
> It sets the **expectations** around that data, defines how it should be **governed**,
> and facilitates the **explicit** generation of quality data that meets the business requirements.

## Definition by Atlan
* Source: https://atlan.com/data-contracts/

> A data contract outlines how data can get exchanged between two parties.
> It defines the structure, format, and rules of exchange in a distributed
> data architecture. These formal agreements make sure that there are not
> any uncertainties or undocumented assumptions about data.

![Data contracts: API-based agreements](img/data-contracts-producers-and-consumers-2023-05.webp)

> Without high-quality data, every analytics initiative will be underwhelming
> at best and actively damaging the business at worst. Data contracts
> are API-based agreements between producers and consumers designed to solve
> exactly that problem Data Contracts are not a new concept.
> They are simply new implementations of a very old idea
> — that producers and consumers should work together to generate high-quality,
> semantically valid data from the ground up.

## Definition by Jean-Georges Perrin
* Source: https://medium.com/profitoptics/data-contract-101-568a9adbf9a9

> A data contract acts as an agreement between multiple parties; specifically,
> a data producer and its consumer(s). A data contract:
> * Creates a link between data producers and data consumers.
> * Creates a link between a logical representation of the data and its physical implementation.
> * Describes “meta meta” data: rules, quality, and behavior (yes, there are two metas in this sentence).

## Definition by David Jayatillake
* Source: https://davidsj.substack.com/p/yet-another-post-on-data-contracts

> In short, **a Data Contract is an enforceable agreement on structure
> and format between the producer and consumer of data**.
> You could even define it in a simpler way:
> **a Data Contract is a guarantee on structure and format by a producer
> of data**.

#### Excerpts
dbt Core v1.5 is slated for release at the end of April, and it will include three new constructs:
* [Access](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/govern/model-access):
  Choose which models ought to be “private” (implementation details, handling complexity within one team or domain) and “public” (an intentional interface, shared with other teams). Other groups and projects can only ref a model — that is, take a critical dependency on it — in accordance with its access.
* [Contracts](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/govern/model-contracts):
  Define the structure of a model explicitly. If your model’s SQL doesn’t match the specified column names and data types, it will fail to build. Breaking changes (removing, renaming, retyping a column) will be caught during CI. On data platforms that support build-time constraints, ensure that columns are not null or pass custom checks while a model is being built, in addition to more flexible testing after.
* [Versions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/govern/model-versions):
  A single model can have multiple versioned definitions, with the same name for downstream reference. When a mature model with an enforced contract and public access needs to undergo a breaking change, rather than breaking downstream queriers immediately, facilitate their migration by bumping the version and communicating a deprecation window.

In the future, individual teams will own their own data. Data engineering will own “core tables” or “conformed dimensions” that will be used by other teams. Ecommerce will own models related to site visits and conversion rate. Ops will own data related to fulfillment. Etc. Each of these teams will reference the public interfaces exposed by other teams as a part of their work, and periodically release upgrades as versions are incremented on upstream dependencies. Teams will review PRs for their own models, and so have more context for what “good” looks like. Monitoring and alerting will happen in alignment with teams and codebases, so there will be real accountability to delivering a high quality, high reliability data product. Teams will manage their own warehouse spend and optimize accordingly. And teams will be able to publish their own metrics all the way into their analytics tool of choice.

# Tools and frameworks

## Schemata
* Homepage: [GitHub - Schemata](https://github.com/ananthdurai/schemata)
* Schema modeling framework for decentralized domain-driven ownership of data.
  It combines a set of standard metadata definitions for each schema
  and data field and a scoring algorithm to provide a feedback loop
  on how efficient the data modeling of the data warehouse is.
  It supports ProtoBuf, dbt and Avro formats. It may support OpenDataMesh
  and/or Smithy in the future

## Datacontract.com specification and CLI
* `datacontract` command-line (CLI) utility: https://github.com/datacontract/cli
* Datacontract.com specification:
  https://datacontract.com/
* Inspired from the Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS); see below

## Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS)
* Home page: https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard
* New version of the PayPal data contract template (see below)
* See above the Datacontract.com specification and CLI
  for an actual implementation

## PayPal data contract templates
* Homepage: https://github.com/paypal/data-contract-template
* This project describes the data contract being used in the implementation
  of Data Mesh at PayPal. It is available as an Apache 2.0 license.

## PolyExpose: a simplistic Polyglot data tool
* Homepage: https://github.com/velascoluis/polyexpose
* Prototype, simplistic Python package implementing the following concepts
  + The ultimate goal to ensure reusability, Data mesh answer is to introduce
    the concept of polyglot data, an abstraction to clearly differentiate
	between the data semantics and the data consumption format/syntax.
  + This is a very elegant approach with a very clear separation of
    responsibilities between semantics and its underlying technology,
	but as Data Mesh does not prescribe any kind of technical architecture,
	sometimes this can be challenging to visualize or implement.
  + The idea of [this repository](https://github.com/velascoluis/polyexpose)
    is to present a potential technology architecture that implements
	this pattern using as many open source components as possible
